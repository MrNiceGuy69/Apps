        question: "Is direct mail 'dead'?",
        answer: "It's the opposite. While digital is a crowded, noisy battlefield, the mailbox is a protected space. The average household gets 100+ emails a day but only 2 pieces of mail. In a world of digital fatigue, a physical, oversized 9x12 mailer is a pattern interrupt. It doesn't just get 'opened'â€”it gets held, considered, and acted upon."
    },
    {
        question: "What kind of businesses does this work for?",
        answer: "This works for any local service or retail business that wants more customers. We've seen massive success with gyms, plumbers, electricians, realtors, restaurants, salons, dentists, and more. If you serve a local geography, this is built for you."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I know if I actually got any leads?",
        answer: "We believe in tracking, not guessing. With our Premium package, we provide a unique call tracking number and a trackable QR code for your ad. You get a simple report showing exactly how many calls and website visits your ad generated. For the first time, you'll see a direct line from your ad dollars to your bank account."
    },
    {
        question: "Why is this so cheap compared to doing it myself?",
        answer: "That's the 'shared mailer' economic advantage. A solo 9x12 mailing to 5,000 homes would cost you over $3,000 in printing and postage alone. By sharing the mailer with a handful of non-competing businesses, you get the same 'shock and awe' impact for a fraction of the price. It's leverage."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I don't like the ad design?",
        answer: "Our pro design service is included for free, and we offer unlimited revisions. We will work with you until you are 100% thrilled with your ad design before it goes to print. Your satisfaction is non-negotiable."
